ReMix
=====

ReMix is a Heterogeneous Reasoning (HR) framework and toolbox. Prove theorems with
predicate logic, spider diagrams, or many other reasoning systems all in one proof.
ReMix is designed for modern software development and use, notably to be deployed
online, and build from a collection of freestanding services. ReMix is based on
(MixR)[http://github.com/urbas/mixr], another HR framework.
